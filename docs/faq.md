# FAQ (Frequently asked Questions)

## Why is Spigot not supported?

Spigot still uses the ancient [Spigot BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) to distribute itself,
because those take very long to run and only run in Git Bash (on Windows) we decided to not support Spigot

## Do you support ARM?

Whilst we generally support arm, we do not provide precompiled binaries for ARM (since GitHub actions doesn't support
ARM runners). However, you can compile the project yourself (See [Compiling from source](#compiling-from-source))
